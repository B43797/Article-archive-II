    <h1>GPS Method – Goldbach Conjecture Verified up to 10<sup>10000</sup></h1>

    <h2>About the Method</h2>
    <p>
      The GPS method is a deterministic algorithm developed to verify the Goldbach Conjecture for even integers by systematically identifying prime pairs (p, q) such that p + q = N. The approach combines prime tracking, symmetry, and gap filtering to ensure precision and high performance up to very large numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major milestone was reached with successful verification for all even numbers ≤ 10<sup>10000</sup>. This surpasses all previously recorded efforts and is now made public through this GitHub repository.

    <h2>Scientific Impact</h2>
    <p>
      This project confirms the validity of Goldbach’s Conjecture for a range never tested before. It complements existing theoretical results and proposes an innovative path toward large-scale validation using deterministic methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method is available to the public for review, educational use, and reproducibility.
