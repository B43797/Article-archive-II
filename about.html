  <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <p>
    This archive presents verified Goldbach decompositions for even numbers up to selected large bounds.
    It is based on a method I developed and validated, allowing decomposition into two primes even beyond 10<sup>18</sup> in some cases.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to provide clear, simple, and public access to this number theory result through well-structured archives, without relying on heavy computation at runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
    The method, now named <strong>Goldbach-GPS</strong>, is my own original work and is made publicly available for educational and scientific purposes.
